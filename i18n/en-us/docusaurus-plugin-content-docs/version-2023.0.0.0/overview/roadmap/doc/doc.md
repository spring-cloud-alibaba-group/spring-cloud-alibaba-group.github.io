### Current documentation issues in the community

Currently, community-related documents are mainly concentrated in the spring-cloud-alibaba-docs module. The document is written in adoc as a whole, and the project documentation is based on [Spring Cloud official website](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-alibaba), which is not conducive to the long-term development of the project and timely update and iteration of the document. The project's Example example documentation is in the Readme document of each example module. Weekly community meetings and technical blogs cannot be published in time.

There are mainly the following problems:

1. Project documents cannot be updated in time;
2. The distribution of project documents is relatively messy, it is not easy to maintain and update uniformly, and the maintenance cost is high;
3. The content of the project weekly meeting cannot be synchronized in time;
4. Nowhere to store community-related blogs and learning resources.

### solution

After discussion at the meeting, the community decided to establish an official document website, which is convenient for users and the smooth development of community work.

### Document official website construction plan

1. The project was officially approved in March, and researched and selected implementation methods and related technology stacks;
2. The content of the document will be improved in mid-March, and it is expected to be completed by the end of June;
3. From early June to mid-July, improve the official website details and review document content;
4. It will be officially released in mid-July.
