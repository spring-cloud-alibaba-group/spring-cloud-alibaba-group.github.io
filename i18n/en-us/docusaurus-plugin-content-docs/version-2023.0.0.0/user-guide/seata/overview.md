&emsp;&emsp;Seata is an open source distributed transaction solution, dedicated to providing high-performance and easy-to-use distributed transaction services under the microservice architecture. Before Seata was open-sourced, its internal version had been playing the role of middleware for data consistency at the application architecture layer within the Ali system, helping the economy to survive the 11.11 events over the years and providing strong technical support for upper-level businesses. After years of precipitation and accumulation, its commercial products have been sold on Alibaba Cloud and Financial Cloud successively. In January 2019, in order to create a more complete technical ecology and inclusive technical achievements, Seata officially announced that it would be open source. In the future, Seata will help users quickly implement distributed transaction solutions in the form of community co-construction.
